# Dylan Do's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am Dylan Do, a Master of Molecular Science and Software Engineering graduate at UC Berkeley. I have a strong passion for learning and a dedication to
software engineering/machine learning/AI development/data science.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++, Java, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Software Development**: Computer Vision, Data Science, Cellular Automata, Monte Carlo Simulation

## Projects
### Movie Recommendation System with Content-Based Filtering
- Developed a movie recommendation engine using content-based filtering by extracting features (e.g., genres, ratings, keywords) to compute movie similarity and return personalized suggestions based on user inputs
- Built full-stack app using Flask backend and React frontend, with REST API support and interactive movie search. Applied K-Means clustering to group similar movies for exploratory browsing and cold-start recommendations

### Predictive Machine Learning Workflow
- Designed and deployed a Python-based interactive UI and backend system to streamline analysis of biological data, allowing data scientists to improve experimental workflow efficiency


### Computer Vision Data Science Project
- Led a team effort to  to classify disaster types and damage severity using high-resolution satellite images
- Implemented logistic regression models, extracted features using techniques like Sobel edge detection and Gabor filters
- Conducted data exploration, feature extraction, and model training using Jupyter Notebooks and Python

### Cellular Automata Library
- Coordinated with a cross-functional team to design and implement a C++ general-purpose software library for a Cellular Automata Model
- Contributed to the architectural design of the software, emphasizing modularity, efficiency, and scalability to accommodate diverse applications of Cellular Automata Models

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Engineered a Monte Carlo simulation for noble gas fluids, collaborating closely with a cross-functional team to ensure optimal performance
- Benchmarked the simulation program against National Institute of Standards and Technology standards to ensure accurate and reliable performance
